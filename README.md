Two Covid Datasets (JSON format) were used to extract data.

Dataset - 1: - https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/data.min.json

DataSet - 2: - https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/timeseries.min.json

I used Python to extract the data and convert it into csv format from the json files. Used Python Libraries: - Pandas, Requests, Numpy, and JSON

PFA related file of data extraction: - (“Covid_Project_json_to_csv.ipynb”)

Extracted and cleaned multiple tables are stored in "csv_files” folder.

Used SQL and Excel to get insights from those tables. “Covid_Project.sql” file contains all sql queries used to derive insights.

Also used some statistics for getting some statistical insights like recovery rate, rates of deaths, Etc and plotted the required graphs using Excel.

main_dashboard.xlsx” file contains the summarised Dashboard. There are multiple dashboards in this file which are interactive.

"project_presenation" file contains the presentation of all the data derived and anaysis of the data.
