# COVID Data Analysis

An analysis project focused on extracting, cleaning, and deriving insights from COVID-19 datasets. Python libraries, SQL, and Excel were used to process and visualize the data.

## Project Overview

The **COVID-19 India: Data Analysis** project involves extracting COVID-19 data from two JSON datasets. The data is then processed using Python libraries such as Pandas, Requests, Numpy, and JSON. Extracted data is converted to CSV format for further analysis. SQL queries, Excel, and statistical methods were employed to derive insights from the cleaned data. The project culminates in interactive dashboards and a presentation of the findings.

## Data Extraction and Preprocessing

Two COVID-19 datasets were used for this project:
- [Dataset 1](https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/data.min.json)
- [Dataset 2](https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/timeseries.min.json)

Python was used to extract data from JSON files and convert it to CSV format. Key libraries utilized include Pandas, Requests, Numpy, and JSON. The data extraction process is documented in the "Covid_Project_json_to_csv.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Analysis

The extracted and cleaned data was analyzed using a combination of SQL queries and Excel. SQL queries are documented in the "Covid_Project.sql" file, providing insights derived from various tables.

## Insights and Visualizations

Statistical methods were applied to calculate recovery rates, death rates, and other relevant metrics. Visualizations, such as graphs, were created using Excel to represent key findings in an informative and engaging manner.

## Project Files

- `Covid_Project_json_to_csv.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data extraction and conversion from JSON to CSV.
